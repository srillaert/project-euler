# Project Euler solutions
My solutions to Project Euler problems.
Project Euler is the website at https://projecteuler.net/ where one can solve, mostly mathematical oriented, problems by writing small computer programs.
I arrived at most of my solutions first by writing a Python program, some of them I later rewrote in C for faster execution or just the fun of it.

After solving a problem I often compared my solution with how other people solved the same problem.
Next to the problem forums on the projecteuler.net website itself, I found the following websites quite useful for this:

Have fun solving !
