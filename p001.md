## Multiples of 3 or 5

### Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.

### Solution

The straightforward solution is to iterate through all natural numbers below $1000$ and sum those divisible by $3$ or $5$. This approach is simple and any computer can perform it quickly. It's also the method I used in my code.

But we can also solve this problem by just using pen and paper by using the arithmetic series sum formula : 

The sum of all the multiples of \( 3 \) below \( 1000 \) is:
\[
3 + 6 + 9 + \dots + 996 + 999
\]
This is an arithmetic series with first term \( a = 3 \), last term \( l = 999 \), common difference \( d = 3 \) and the number of terms is \( n = 333 \). The sum of the series is:
\[
S_3 = \frac{n}{2}(a + l) = \frac{333}{2}(3 + 999) = \frac{333 \times 1002}{2} = 333 \times 501 = \boxed{166833}
\]

Similarly the sum of all the multiples of $5$ below $1000$ is:
\[
S_5 = 5 + 10 + 15 + \dots + 990 + 995
= \frac{199}{2}(5 + 995) = \frac{199 \times 1000}{2} = 199 \times 500 = \boxed{99500}
\]

To find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ we can't simply add the two sums - doing so would double-count the numbers that are multiples of both $3$ and $5$. These overlapping numbers are precisely the multiples of $15$. To correct for this, we need to substract the sum of all multiples of $15$ below $1000$.

\[
S_{15} = 15 + 30 + 45 + \dots + 975 + 990
= \frac{66}{2}(15 + 990) = 33 \times 1005 = \boxed{33165}
\]

\[
\textbf{Solution}  = S_3 + S_5 - S_{15} = 166833 + 99500 - 33165 = \boxed{233168}
\]
