## Problem 500!!!

### Problem

The number of divisors of 120 is 16.
In fact 120 is the smallest number having 16 divisors.

Find the smallest number with $2^{500500}$ divisors.
Give your answer modulo 500500507.

### Solution

The number of divisors of a number $n$ is denoted by $d(n)$ and is given by:
```math
d(n) = \prod (e_i + 1)
```

where $e_i$ are the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$. That is, if
```math
n = \prod p_i^{e_i}
```

where $p_i$ are prime numbers, then the number of divisors is computed using the exponents $e_i$.

We need to find the smallest number with exactly $2^{500500}$ divisors. This means:
```math
\prod (e_i + 1) = 2^{500500}
```

For a product to be a power of 2, every factor in the product must itself be a power of 2. Thus, each $e_i + 1$ must be of the form:
```math
e_i + 1 = 2^{k_i}
```

which means the possible values for $e_i$ are:
```math
e_i = 1, 3, 7, 15, \dots
```

corresponding to $ e_i = 2^{k_i} - 1 $.

To find the smallest number its smallest prime factors should have the largest exponents $e_i$ so that if $p_1 \lt p_2 \lt \dots \lt p_n$ then $k_1 \ge k_2 \ge \dots \ge k_n$.
