Some solutions only use the first x digits of each number and add these up. This works out in this case but not in general.

Or consider 10^49 + 10^49-1 = 1999..999 and 10^49+1 = 1000..001.
Only adding the first x digits gives a sum starting with 2999999999 while the correct sum starts with 3000000000.

That is why the solutions here use *all* the digits.
